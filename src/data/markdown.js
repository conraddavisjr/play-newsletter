	**Empowering more teens to code**

	We recently teamed up with Girls Who Code this week to help young women develop and maintain interest in Computer Science by promoting a new series of books on Google Play. Published by Penguin, the new collection on Google Play will include 13 books focused on coding, such as nonfiction book,* **[Girls Who Code: Learn to Code and Change the Worl*d](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Reshma_Saujani_Girls_Who_Code?id=i_mcDQAAQBAJ&e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign), and a fiction book, *[The Friendship Cod*e](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Stacia_Deutsch_The_Friendship_Code_1?id=WprUDQAAQBAJ). You can also expect to see a coding-themed journal, activity book, board books, and more! Separately, you can also find some recommended books for coding [here](https://play.google.com/store/books/collection/promotion_10027e0_kids_gwc_books?e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign). 

	**Back to school**

	Saying goodbye to summer and hello to a new school year can be rough, but we’ve got the best tools to ease the transition. See our new [editorial page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/topic?id=android_excellence_3002b1f_apps_backtoschool2017_focus&hl=en&e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign) of clever apps that we recommend, such as [NeuroNation - Brain Training](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.nn.mobile.app.main&hl=en&e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign), [Mindly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/topic?id=android_excellence_3002b1f_apps_backtoschool2017_focus&hl=en&e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign), [Headspace: Guided Meditation & Mindfulness](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getsomeheadspace.android&hl=en) and more, to help you dive into your studies feeling rested, centered, and focused. 

	Students can also rent or purchase textbooks through Google Play. Right now we have sales on popular textbooks from [McGraw Hill](https://play.google.com/store/books/collection/promotion_10027da_textbooks_mcgraw_hill_sale) and [Elsevier](https://play.google.com/store/books/collection/promotion_1002786_elsevier_textbook_sale_fall_2017), as well as deals on titles in dozens of other subjects. Reading your textbooks on Google Play has tons of other benefits -- you can use sticky notes and highlights within the text to call out key points, sync your reading across devices, and you can even push your notes to Google Drive and use Docs to create a study guide.

	**WHAT’S TRENDING**

	Music fans can’t get enough of Jay-Z’s newest album "[4:44](https://play.google.com/store/music/album/JAY_Z_4_44?id=Bhlerbl7hnpkofs7fdnt6ljnx64&hl=en)" and the bilingual song of the summer “[Despacito (Remix) (feat. Justin Bieber)](https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Luis_Fonsi_Daddy_Yankee_Despacito_Remix?id=Bnnwic4fkpwhn34md7aoetwhvei&hl=en)” by Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee, which both stayed on the top of the charts for the second month in a row as the number one purchased album and most streamed song in August. Google Play readers got lost in the woods with international #1 bestselling author Karin Slaughter’s new novel, [The Good Daughter](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Karin_Slaughter_The_Good_Daughter?id=BhqaDQAAQBAJ), while gamers immersed themselves in the super-charged first-person shooter game[ Titanfall: Assault](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexonm.tfa).
